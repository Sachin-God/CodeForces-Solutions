- Solutions primarily written in C++ for optimal performance

## 📖 Usage Notes

> **🎓 For Learning Purposes Only**

This repository is intended to help fellow competitive programmers learn and understand different approaches to problem-solving. Please note:

- **Learn, Don't Copy**: Use these solutions to understand concepts and techniques
- **Practice First**: Always attempt problems independently before reviewing solutions
- **Academic Integrity**: Don't submit these solutions directly in live contests
- **Build Understanding**: Focus on the algorithmic thinking behind each solution
